# ESP8266_GWC

## Description

This project consists of:

- NodeMCU V3 ESP8266 Board
- MH-ET LCD keypad shield
- 2xDS18B20 temperature sensors
- 2PH3091A relay
- GSD326.1A rotary air damper actuator

### Functionality

This project aims to control air damper actuator via relay, depending on data provided by DS18B20 temperature sensors.  
Wake temperatures and difference between temperatures on both sensors have to be selected by user.
